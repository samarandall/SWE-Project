# This is the start of the pygame readme

## for development right now
1. start the virtual environment which should have pygame installed as well as other modules
    * command to start the venv: source venv/bin/activate
    * command to stop the venv: deactivate
2. i initialized with python3, but that should work either way, i think python3 should be the environment for the venv
3. run python3 main.py which should start the game

## TODO
1. figure out more about graphics
2. is this working???? - Victor
